Principle #5: Businesspeople and Developers Must Work Together Daily Throughout the Project. Agile teams sometimes
forget that the businesspeople they work with have day jobs. This leads to a natural disconnect between software teams
and the businesspeople they build software for. To build software well, teams need to have a lot of face-to-face
discussion with businesspeople, because they need to tap into their knowledge of the company’s problems that are going
to be solved with software. The businesspeople got that knowledge by solving those same problems without software. So
for most businesspeople who work with software teams, the software project is typically a small part of their job. For
most of them, in an ideal world, the team would have very little contact with them. They’d have a meeting or two, figure
out what the software needs to do, and then come back a short time later with perfect, working software. The teams, on
the other hand, want as much contact with the businesspeople as possible. Programmers need to learn about the business
problem that needs to be solved. They do this by talking to businesspeople, watching them work, and looking at what they
produce. A programmer who needs this information would love to have each businessperson’s full-time attention. The
longer they have to wait to get their questions answered, the slower their projects progress. But the businesspeople
don’t want to spend all of their time with the software team, because they have jobs to get back to. So who wins? Agile
teams have a way past this problem that lets both the businesspeople and the developers win together. They start with an
understanding that the team is delivering valuable software to the company. The finished software is worth money to the
company. If that value is more than the cost to build the software, it’s worth it for the company to invest in its
development. A good project should be valuable enough that the businesspeople can see that it’s worth the effort they’ll
need to put in over the course of the project When businesspeople and developers build software as a team, it’s most
efficient in the long run to work together daily throughout the project. That’s because the alternative is to have the
businesspeople wait until late in the project to look over the team’s work and give feedback, and it’s much more
expensive to make changes at the end of the project. It takes a lot less of everyone’s time if they catch those changes
as early as possible. Working daily with the team actually requires less of each businessperson’s time over the course
of the project. This is why teams that deliver working software frequently should prioritize the most valuable features
first—so the businesspeople can get that value delivered early. It’s part of the bargain. It’s also why good agile teams
consider the businesspeople to be an important part of the team, and equal members with the programmers. That’s a big
distinction between an agile team and a traditional team. The traditional team treats the business user as a customer to
be negotiated with; the agile team collaborates with the customer (typically the product owner) as someone with an equal
say in the way the project is run. (That gets back to the core agile value of customer collaboration over contract
negotiation!) A good product owner can help reduce the amount of time the businesspeople spend with the team. They still
need to meet daily, but the product owner can concentrate on understanding the value of the software and the business
problem that needs to be solved. That way, the team can use their face-to-face time with the businesspeople to validate
information that they’ve already learned from the product owner.
