      <h2>Principle #5:</h2>
      <h4 class="sub-heading">Businesspeople and Developers Must Work Together</h4>
      <p class="summary">
        The fifth Agile principle states that businesspeople and developers must collaborate daily throughout a project.
      </p>
      <p class="summary">
        This addresses the natural disconnect between these groups, where businesspeople, focused on their core
        responsibilities, prefer minimal interaction, while developers need constant engagement to understand the
        business problems the software aims to solve.
      </p>
      <p class="summary">
        Agile resolves this by recognizing that daily collaboration, although seemingly time-consuming, actually reduces
        overall effort and cost by catching changes early. This frequent interaction allows for timely feedback,
        preventing expensive late-stage revisions.
      </p>
      <p class="summary">
        Agile teams consider businesspeople, especially 'product owners' as equal members, shifting from a
        customer-negotiation model to a collaborative one.
      </p>
      <p class="summary">
        Product owners can streamline communication by understanding both the software's value and the business problem,
        enabling focused discussions during face-to-face meetings and ensuring the development of valuable software.
