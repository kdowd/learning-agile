        <h2>Principle #5:</h2>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Businesspeople and Developers Must Work Together</h4>
        <p class="summary">
            TThe fifth Agile principle states that businesspeople and developers must collaborate daily throughout a
            project. This
            addresses the natural disconnect between these groups, where
            businesspeople, focused on their core responsibilities, prefer minimal interaction, while developers need
            constant
            engagement to understand the business problems the software aims to solve.
            Agile resolves this by recognizing that daily collaboration, although seemingly time-consuming, actually
            reduces overall
            effort and cost by catching changes early. This frequent interaction
            allows for timely feedback, preventing expensive late-stage revisions. Agile teams consider businesspeople,
            especially
            product owners, as integral and equal members, shifting from a
            customer-negotiation model to a collaborative one. Product owners can streamline communication by
            understanding both the
            software's value and the business problem, enabling focused discussions
            during face-to-face meetings and ensuring the development of valuable software.
