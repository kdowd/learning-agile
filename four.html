Principle #4: The Most Efficient and Effective Method of Conveying Information To and Within a Development Team Is
Face-To-Face Conversation. Agile practitioners recognize that documentation is just another form of communication.4 When
I write a document and hand it to you, the goal is not to write documentation. The goal is to make sure that the ideas
in my head match the ideas in your head as closely as possible. In many cases, documentation is a good tool to
accomplish that goal—but it’s not the only communication tool that we have. Figure 3-3. When people on the team don’t
communicate, they may agree on the broad strokes, but end up working toward different goals. Comprehensive documentation
can make this worse by making it easy to introduce ambiguity. Face-to-face communication is almost always a better tool
for sharing ideas within a software team than documentation. Everybody knows that talking through a problem in person is
the most effective way to understand a new idea. We’re all much more likely to retain ideas that were expressed in
conversation than if we’d read them on a page or in a Microsoft Word document. That’s why agile communication practices
focus most on individual people communicating with each other, and reserve documentation for those cases where complex
information needs to be recalled in detail later. Luckily, it’s not hard for teams that are used to comprehensive
documentation to move to more effective face-to-face communication. That’s because most of those teams don’t actually
try to hit the “ideal” of complete comprehensive documentation and traceability. Software engineers are notoriously
practical. When they see how much work is involved in building up that comprehensive documentation, they end up having
those face-to-face conversations anyway. In the end, that’s the only way they can effectively build software. By
recognizing that comprehensive documentation is often inappropriate, they can stop feeling guilty for not accomplishing
the impossible—building perfect, comprehensive documentation—because it would not, in fact, be particularly useful for
their projects if they did! Instead, the most efficient way for the team to communicate the important ideas needed for
the project is to get everyone thinking the same way. That way, each person can handle every decision as it comes. When
a group of people look at the world the same way, and communicate about both positive and negative ideas openly, they
end up with a shared perspective. When a change comes along that requires rethinking, the team members don’t have to
explain as much to each other. The ultimate goal for team communication is to create a sense of community so that
there’s a lot of implied knowledge, because it’s just not efficient to explain the same thing over and over again.
Without that sense of community, people in different roles have to work harder to match each other’s perspectives. The
closer the team gets to having a sense of community and a shared perspective, the more often each person will
independently come to a similar answer when posed the same question. This gives them a much more stable ground for
handling changes, because they can get past the conflicts and start working on the code—and won’t have to get
sidetracked managing documentation.
