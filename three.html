      <h2>Principle #3:</h2>
      <h4 class="sub-heading">Deliver Working Software Frequently</h4>
      <p class="summary">
        The third Agile principle emphasizes frequent delivery of working software, ideally every few weeks to a couple
        of months.
      </p>

      <p class="summary">
        This approach contrasts sharply with traditional "command-and-control" project management, which often struggles
        to accommodate changes without chaos. Agile tackles this by using iterative development with regular, short
        cycles (iterations). Each iteration concludes with a demo for the customer and a retrospective for the team,
        followed by planning for the next cycle.
      </p>

      <p class="summary">
        This frequent delivery, coupled with constant checkpoints, enables early detection and integration of changes in
        a blame-free environment.
      </p>

      <p class="summary">
        For traditional project managers, this provides a way to control deadlines and manage late-stage changes more
        effectively, as the entire team becomes involved in spotting issues earlier.
      </p>

      <p class="summary">
        The project manager's role shifts from dictating tasks to collaborating with the team, ensuring everyone is
        aligned with overarching goals, which is facilitated by the clear, short-term objectives of each iteration and
        the collective responsibility for delivering working software.
