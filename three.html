Principle #3: Deliver Working Software Frequently, from a Couple of Weeks to a Couple of Months, with a Preference to
the Shorter Timescale. You might be thinking that the idea of welcoming changing requirements is interesting, and could
help your projects. But you might also be thinking that it sounds terrible. This is not an uncommon reaction to the
idea. Many people who work on software teams—especially traditional project managers—are very uncomfortable with the
idea of welcoming changes when they first encounter it. These project managers deal with changes every day, but the
agile attitude toward change is very different than what they are used to. Agile practitioners refer to the traditional
attitude toward project changes as command-and-control. The term “command-and-control” is borrowed from the military. In
our 2010 book, Beautiful Teams, we interviewed Northrop Grumman chief engineer Neil Siegel, who gave us a military
definition of the term: Andrew: I’m not familiar with military systems—what’s a command-and-control system? Neil: An
information system for military commanders. It allows them to communicate with each other, and allows them to maintain
situational awareness: where everybody is, what their status is. It’s how a commander can understand what’s going on.
Battlefields used to be small areas—a commander could stand on a hill with a pair of binoculars and could see what was
going on. But by about 1900, the battlefields started getting so big that you couldn’t stand on the hill like Napoleon
did. You had to start using technology to “see” the entire battlefield. And the systems that do that are called
“command-and-control systems.” Command-and-control project management is similar to military command-and-control:
“Command” refers to the way the project manager assigns work to the team. The team may not report directly to her, but
she has control over their assignments. She breaks down the work, builds a schedule, and assigns activities to the
resources on her team. “Control” refers to the way she manages changes. Every project has changes along the way: work
takes longer than anticipated, people take sick days or leave the project, hardware is not available or breaks, and all
sorts of other unexpected things happen. Project managers constantly monitor for these changes, and then control the
project by evaluating each change as it occurs, updating the plans to incorporate the change into the schedule and
documentation, giving the team new assignments, and managing their stakeholders’ expectations so that nobody is
blindsided. The reason a traditional project manager is uncomfortable with welcoming change when she first encounters it
is because she recognizes that those same problems will happen on agile projects too, and the team needs to be able to
respond to them. Simply accepting changes and welcoming them seems like a guaranteed way to introduce chaos to the
project. If agile teams don’t use command-and-control, how do they manage to keep up with all of those changes while
still dealing with the normal day-to-day issues that project teams always face? The key to welcoming changes without
introducing chaos lies in delivering working software frequently. The team uses iteration to break the project into
regular deadlines. During the iterations, the team delivers working software. At the end of each iteration, the team
holds a demo to show the customer what they built, and a retrospective to look back and see what lessons can be learned.
Then they start a planning session to figure out what they’ll build in the next iteration. The predictable schedule and
the constant checkpoints help the team catch those changes early, and give everyone a blame-free environment where they
can discuss each change and come up with a strategy to incorporate it into the project. This is where agile starts to
become very attractive to a traditional command-and-control project manager. A command-and-control project manager wants
to control the deadline. Timeboxed iterations give the project manager that control. This also solves one of the project
manager’s biggest challenges: dealing with changes that come in very late in the project. One of the most difficult
parts of a traditional project manager’s job is monitoring for changes. The daily reviews and iteration retrospectives
let the project manager enlist the whole team as eyes and ears to spot those changes much earlier, before they can cause
more serious problems with the project. The project manager’s role starts to shift away from command-and-control, where
she gave the team a daily battle plan and constantly adjusted to keep them on track. Instead, now she’s working with the
team to make sure that each person is constantly looking at the big picture and working toward the same goals. It’s
easier to do that when the team is working on a short iteration that will deliver working software. This gives each
person concrete goals, and a much better idea of what everyone is delivering—and a sense that each person is responsible
not only for what he built, but also for what the entire team will deliver at the end of the iteration.
