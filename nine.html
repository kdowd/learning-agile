Principle #9: Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design Enhances Agility. Poor estimates aren’t the
only cause of late nights and weekends. Most developers recognize that sinking, pit-of-the-stomach feeling that comes
with the realization that a seemingly simple bit of coding turned out to be a nightmare to design. There go the next
three weekends, which will now be spent tracking down bugs and patching up code.  It’s a lot faster in the long run to
avoid a bug now than it is to fix it later. And it’s a lot easier to maintain code that’s well designed, because
well-designed code is built in a way that’s easy to extend. The last two decades or so have brought us a revolution in
software design. Object-oriented design and analysis, design patterns, decoupled and service-oriented architecture, and
other innovations have given developers patterns and tools to bring technical excellence to every project. But this
doesn’t mean that agile teams spend a lot of time creating large-scale designs at the start of every software project.
Agile developers build up great coding habits that help them create well-designed code. They’re constantly on the
lookout for design and code problems, and take the time to fix those problems as soon as they’re discovered. By taking a
little extra time during the project to write solid code and fix problems today, they create a codebase that’s easy to
maintain tomorrow.
