Principle #6: Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals. Give Them the Environment and Support They Need, and Trust
Them to Get the Job Done. Projects run best when everyone in the company recognizes that the team is building valuable
software, and when everyone on the team—including the product owner—understands what makes the software valuable to the
company.  On the other hand, projects can break down in an environment where people don’t see the value in the software,
or where they aren’t rewarded for building the software well. It’s actually not uncommon for companies to set up
performance reviews and compensation systems that discourage people from building software in an effective, agile way,
and this can work against the project. Some common “incentives” that work against agile teams include: Giving
programmers poor performance reviews when code reviews routinely turn up bugs, and rewarding them for “clean” code
reviews. (This just leads programmers to stop finding bugs in code reviews.) Rewarding testers for the number of bugs
that they report. (This encourages nitpicking and poor reporting, and discourages them from partnering with the
programmers, because it sets up an antagonistic relationship between them.) Basing business analysts’ performance
reviews on the amount of documentation they produce (rather than the amount of knowledge they’ve shared with the team).
Ultimately, everyone’s performance should be based on what the team delivers, rather than the specific role that they
played in it. Now, that’s not to say that a programmer who does a poor job or is disruptive shouldn’t be called out for
it in a review with his boss. People should be reviewed based on their contribution (or lack thereof) toward the whole
team’s goals. But they should definitely not be discouraged from looking beyond the strict confines of a specific role.
A good environment for a team will reward a programmer who recognizes a part of the business problem that isn’t being
addressed and fixes it, or a tester who sees a problem with the code or architecture and raises that with the team. An
environment like this gives everyone on the team the support they need, and makes the project more successful.
Comprehensive documentation and traceability matrices are a particularly insidious source of problems with a team’s
environment and support. Instead of encouraging an environment of trust, they encourage a “cover your ass” (CYA)
attitude in which teams move toward a “contract negotiation” approach, rather than customer collaboration. A tester with
a CYA attitude will spend time making sure every requirement has a test, whether or not it does anything to actually
help the quality of the software. Developers will CYA by adhering to the letter of the requirement, without bothering to
think about whether or not it actually delivers value to the users—because if they’re working in a CYA environment,
trying to build what the customer actually needs can get them dinged for not building the software to spec. Business
analysts and product owners will CYA by spending their time making sure that the scope and requirements line up
perfectly, and often find themselves tempted to omit pesky requirements that don’t align perfectly with the existing
documentation, regardless of their value. Software team members need to CYA most in an environment where change is seen
as a bad thing. For a team that uses comprehensive documentation, it’s easy to see change as a bad thing, because it
requires so much work to revisit the scope, update the specs, alter the design, repair the traceability matrices, etc.
This leads to a divisive environment, because managers in that sort of company will naturally try to find a “culprit”
who can be blamed for all that extra work caused by the change. People on the team increasingly turn to “defensive
documentation” to protect themselves when that blame inevitably comes around to them. This forces everyone on the team
to CYA, so they can point to the part of the documentation that they were sticking to, in order to avoid a poor
performance review or punishment. The opposite of CYA is trust. A company that develops only the minimal documentation
needed for the project has an environment where the team is trusted to do the right thing when a change happens. An
agile team with a “we’re all in this together” attitude, where if the project fails everyone shares the blame, doesn’t
need to CYA. It’s easier for them to handle changes, because they don’t need to maintain all of that unnecessary
documentation. Instead, they can tackle the actual problem with face-to-face communication, and only write down what’s
necessary. And they can do this knowing that the company trusts that they’re doing the right thing—even if it causes the
project to take longer.
