Principle #8: Agile Processes Promote Sustainable Development. The Sponsors, Developers, and Users Should Be Able to
Maintain a Constant Pace Indefinitely. The ebook reader team isn’t the first project team to work insane hours in order
to meet an unrealistic deadline. In fact, the hard-and-fast deadline is the primary tool in the command-and-control
project manager’s toolbox. Whenever a deadline is approaching, everyone turns to nights and weekends as the first
resort. An unrealistic deadline can be an underhanded tool to force more work out of a team by squeezing extra hours out
of every week. Except that in the long run, it doesn’t work. It’s well known that a team can crunch for a few weeks and
get more work done, but after that their productivity typically falls off a cliff. This makes sense: people get tired
and demotivated, and fatigue starts to set in. All of those errands and life events they pushed off have to force their
way back in somehow. In fact, teams that work extreme amounts of overtime for an extended period actually deliver less
work than teams that work normal, sane hours—and it’s usually of lower quality. This is why agile teams believe in
maintaining a sustainable pace. They should plan on delivering work that can actually be done in the time they reserve
for it. Iterative development makes this more realistic, because it’s a lot easier to estimate how much software they
can deliver in the next two, four, or six weeks than it is to estimate how much they can deliver in the next year and a
half. By promising to deliver only what they can build, the team creates an environment where late nights and weekends
are rare.5
