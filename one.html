Principle #1: Our Highest Priority Is to Satisfy the Customer Through Early and Continuous Delivery of Valuable
Software. This first principle includes three distinct and important ideas: releasing software early, delivering value
continuously, and satisfying the customer. To really understand the core of this principle, you need to know how those
three things work together. Project teams work in the real world, and in the real world things never go perfectly. Even
a team that does a brilliant job of gathering and writing down requirements will miss things, because it’s impossible to
completely and perfectly capture the requirements for any system. That’s not to say that teams shouldn’t try, and agile
methodologies are based on some great practices for communicating and writing down requirements. But the fact is that
until customers get their hands on working software, they have a hard time envisioning exactly how the software will
work. So if the customer can only give you real, informed feedback after seeing working software, then the best way to
get that feedback is through early delivery: shipping the first working version of the software to the customer as early
as possible. Even if you only deliver a single working feature that the customer can use, that’s still a win. It’s a win
for the team, because the customer can now give informed feedback to help them move the project in the right direction.
It’s also a win for the customers, because they can do something today that they couldn’t do before—with this working
software. Because the software works, and because the customers can actually use it to do something they need, the team
has delivered real value. It might only be a small amount of value, but it’s far better than delivering no value at
all—especially if the alternative is an increasingly frustrated user who has to wait a long time before getting his or
her hands on software from the team. The downside to delivering early is that the software that’s first delivered to the
customers is far from complete. This can be really hard for some users and stakeholders to deal with; while some users
are used to the idea that they’ll see software early, others are much less so. Many people have a hard time when they
are handed software that’s not perfect. In fact, in a lot of companies (especially larger companies where people have
spent years working with software teams), the software team has to literally negotiate the terms under which they’ll
provide software to their stakeholders. When there’s not a great partnership between the team and the people they build
software for, if the team delivers incomplete software, the users and stakeholders may judge it very harshly and even
panic if a feature they expect to see is missing. The core agile values have an answer to this: customer collaboration
over contract negotiation. A team that’s bound to a fixed specification with inflexible bureaucratic barriers to change
doesn’t have the option to let the software evolve over time. A team working under those conditions has to kick off a
whole new change management process, which requires a fresh set of contract negotiations with the customer. On the other
hand, a team that truly collaborates with the customers has the option of making all the necessary changes along the
way. That’s what continuous delivery means. This is why agile methodologies are typically iterative. Agile teams plan
the project’s iterations by choosing the features and requirements that will deliver the most value. The only way that
the team can figure out what features deliver that value is to collaborate with the customer and incorporate the
feedback from the previous iteration. This lets the team satisfy the customer in the short run by demonstrating value
early, and in the long run by delivering the finished product that delivers as much value as possible.
