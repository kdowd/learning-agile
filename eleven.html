        <h2>Principle #11:</h2>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Self-organizing teams.</h4>
        <p class="summary">
            The eleventh Agile principle states that the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
            self-organizing
            teams. This challenges the traditional waterfall approach, where dedicated
            phases for requirements and design often lead to overly complex, upfront planning and extensive
            documentation.
            Self-organizing teams, by contrast, collaboratively plan and continually revise
            their approach, breaking projects into small, valuable chunks and addressing detailed requirements and
            design
            iteratively. This shift means that while a senior architect still plays a crucial
            role, their work becomes more integrated and less isolated. Instead of creating a single, comprehensive
            upfront design,
            agile architects engage in incremental design, ensuring the system is not
            only complete but also adaptable to ongoing changes, ultimately fostering more robust and flexible outcomes.
