        <h2>Principle #9:</h2>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Maximize the amount of work not done - Simple is best.</h4>
        <p class="summary">
            The tenth Agile principle highlights "Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is
            essential." This
            principle addresses the inherent complexity introduced by adding code and
            its dependencies, which can lead to a cascading effect of changes and an unmaintainable codebase. Agile
            advocates for
            minimal planning and iterative development to avoid building unnecessary
            software. While this might initially seem counterintuitive to developers accustomed to comprehensive upfront
            design,
            software development differs from physical construction. Deleting code is
            less destructive than building an overly complex system. Maximizing work not done means focusing on building
            only the
            most valuable and useful features, as the cost of maintaining unnecessary
            code often outweighs its value. Effective simplicity is achieved by creating software with small,
            self-contained units
            that minimize dependencies, thereby preventing complex cascading changes
            and promoting long-term maintainability.
