Principle #7: Working Software Is the Primary Measure of Progress. A good team works to make sure that everyone—team
members, managers, stakeholders, and customers—really understands where the project is at any time. But how do you
actually communicate the status of a project? It’s a much more difficult problem than it might seem at first. A typical
command-and-control project manager tries to keep the project on course and keeps everyone up to date with extensive
schedules and status reports. But it’s hard to capture the real “essence” of a project in a status report. The report
itself is an imperfect communication tool: often, three different people can read the same status report and get three
totally different impressions of where the project is. And status reporting can be highly politically charged for a
project manager. Almost every project manager occasionally finds himself or herself under pressure to leave something
off of a status report that will make a manager or team lead look bad—and it’s always a piece of information that
someone else needs in order to make a decision. So how do you report progress, if status reports aren’t good enough? The
answer lies in working software. The minute you actually see the software working in front of you, you “get” it. You can
see what the software does, and what it doesn’t do. If a manager promised to deliver something that didn’t make it into
the software, it might be embarrassing—but it’s impossible to not communicate that, because the software speaks for
itself. This is one reason why agile teams use iterative development. By delivering working software at the end of each
iteration, and by doing a real product demonstration that shows everyone exactly what the team did, they keep everyone
up to date on the progress of the software in a way that is almost impossible to misread.
