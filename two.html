Principle #2: Welcome Changing Requirements, Even Late In Development. Agile Processes Harness Change for the Customer’s
Competitive Advantage. Many successful agile practitioners have a lot of trouble with this principle when they first
encounter it. It’s easy to talk in abstract terms about welcoming change. But in the heat of a project, when a team runs
into a change that will require a lot of work, things can get emotionally charged—especially for a developer who knows
that his boss will hold him to the old deadline, no matter how much work the change requires. Getting past this,
especially in a culture where people are blamed for delays, can be difficult. But it can also be very rewarding, because
welcoming changing requirements is one of the most powerful tools in the agile toolbox. Why are changes in a project
emotionally charged? Understanding that is a key to this principle. Think back to the last time you were working on a
project and found out that you needed to change what you were building. How did it feel? Until that moment, you thought
the project was going well. You probably made a lot of decisions: how to structure your work, what you were building,
and what you promised to deliver to your customers. Now someone outside of the project is telling you that some of that
planning and work was wrong—that you were wrong. It’s very difficult to accept someone telling you that you’ve been
wrong, especially if you’ve been doing work for that person. Most software engineers are driven by pride of workmanship:
we want to deliver products that we can stand behind, and that satisfy our users’ needs. A change in a project threatens
that, because it’s questioning the path that you’ve taken and the assumptions that you’ve made. Very often, someone is
telling you to change course after explicitly setting you on that course. If that person told you to build one thing,
and you went ahead and built half of it, it’s very frustrating for that same person to then come back to you and say,
“Actually, now that I think about it, can we build something completely different?” It feels disrespectful of the effort
that you put in. Now you have to go back and make changes to things you thought were done. It’s hard not to get
defensive about that! And it gets even worse if you’re the one who’s held responsible for not reading your customer’s
mind and, as a result, blowing your deadline. Almost every professional developer has been through that situation at
least once. In light of that, how can we bring ourselves to welcome changing requirements? The first step toward
welcoming changing requirements is to try to see things from the customer’s perspective. This is not always easy, but
it’s enlightening. Do you think that the customer who originally sent you down the wrong path meant to? What do you
think went through his head when he realized that he told you months ago to build the wrong software, and now you’ve
wasted months of work because of what he said? Coming to you and requesting the change is, to him, admitting that he
made a mistake—a mistake that will cost you a lot of work. That’s not easy to do. No wonder customers often wait a long
time before coming to the team with a change! It’s embarrassing, and they know that they’re delivering bad news. Your
deadline is going to be blown, but so is his. If he has needs, and if the company is spending money building software to
meet those needs, then his needs aren’t getting met, and the project isn’t delivering value. And it’s all his fault,
because he told you the wrong thing at the start of the project. In other words, two people are being asked to do the
impossible. You’re being asked to read the customer’s mind. He’s being asked to predict the future. When you look at it
like that, it starts to become a lot easier to welcome change. On the other hand, if you want to resist project change
and stubbornly stick to the same plan that you wrote at the beginning of the project, it’s easy—just make sure to hire
only telepathic and clairvoyant team members. So what does it mean to welcome change? It means: Nobody gets in “trouble”
when there’s a change. We acknowledge—and our bosses acknowledge—that we’re human and fallible, and that it’s better for
the company to allow us to make mistakes and correct them frequently, rather than expect us to do things perfectly the
first time. We’re all in this together. Everyone on the team, including the customers you’re collaborating with, owns
the requirements and the changes to those requirements. If those requirements are wrong, it’s as much your fault as the
customer’s, so there’s no sense in placing blame for a change. We don’t sit on change until it’s too late. Yes, it’s
embarrassing to have made a mistake. But because we all recognize that, we simply do our best to fix it as early as
possible. That way, the damage is limited. We stop thinking of changes as mistakes. We did our best with the information
we had at the time, and it only became clear that we were wrong because the decisions we made along the way gave us the
perspective to recognize the changes that we have to make today. We learn from the changes. This is the most effective
way for a team to grow and get better at building software together.
