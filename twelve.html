Principle #12: At Regular Intervals, the Team Reflects on How to Become More Effective, Then Tunes and Adjusts Its
Behavior Accordingly. A team isn’t agile until they’re constantly improving the way they build software. Agile teams
constantly inspect and adapt—they look at how their projects have run, and they use that knowledge to improve in the
future. And they don’t just do this at the end of the project; when they meet every day, they look for ways to change,
and they’ll change the work that they’re currently doing if it makes sense.7 You need to be comfortable being brutally
honest with yourself and your teammates about what’s working and what isn’t. This is especially important for teams that
are just beginning down the road of agile development. The only way to become more capable as a team is to constantly
look back at what you’ve done so far, to assess how well you’re working as a team, and to come up with a plan for
getting better. This makes sense, and almost everyone agrees that it’s a good thing to do. But looking back and taking
stock of what went right and wrong is one of those things that many teams genuinely intend to do, but rarely actually
get around to doing. One reason is that it’s uncomfortable at first. It often involves looking at specific problems and
mistakes, and very few people are comfortable publicly pointing out the mistakes that the other people on their team
made. Over time, people on the teams get more and more comfortable talking about these things. Eventually, everyone
starts to see this as more constructive than critical. Another reason that teams don’t do this reflection is that they
never set aside the time to do it—or even if they set aside the time, getting a head start on the next project seems
more important than thinking about the one that’s done. Teams that start each project by reserving time both at the end
of each iteration and at the end of the project to meet, review, assess, and come up with a plan for improvement are
more likely to actually meet and talk about how they did. This helps them learn from their experiences and become more
effective.
