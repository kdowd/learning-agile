        <h2>Principle #12:</h2>
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Reflection - the best form of learning.</h4>
        <p class="summary">
            The twelfth Agile principle emphasizes continuous self-reflection and adaptation: teams regularly assess
            their
            effectiveness, then tune and adjust their behavior accordingly. This commitment to
            "inspect and adapt" is crucial for an agile team's ongoing improvement. It goes beyond end-of-project
            reviews,
            advocating for daily vigilance and willingness to change current work if it
            enhances effectiveness. While initially uncomfortable due to the need for brutal honesty about successes and
            failures,
            this practice fosters constructive criticism and team growth over time.
            Many teams struggle to prioritize this reflection, often due to discomfort or perceived time constraints.
            However, by
            intentionally reserving time for review and planning improvements at the
            end of each iteration and project, teams learn from their experiences, enhancing their capability and
            overall
            effectiveness.
